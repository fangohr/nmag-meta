Need to call these scripts with the prefix 'nmag-meta-scripts' from
the parent directory, i.e.

$> sh nmag-meta-scripts/do-all.sh





* install-sundials

dowloads sundials2.3 and installs locally

* get-nsim-masters.sh

clones the src, doc and test repositories into 'nsim-master'

* compile-nmag

compiles nmag, to be found in nsim-master

* compile-nmag-doc

compiles documentation 

* do-all

does all together (in the right order)
